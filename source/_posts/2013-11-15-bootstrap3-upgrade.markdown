As you might have noticed, we have recently updated our user interface to a more modern and responsive version of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">bootstrap</a>.  This latest version of bootstrap is a little bit sleeker and more mobile friendly.  Nothing has changed except that our site looks a little bit better on your desktop and also on your phones or tablets.  Contact us if you experience any issues by using the <a href="https://laundropro.com/contact_forms/new">contact us</a> link or drop us an email at <a href="mailto:admin@laundropro.com">admin@laundropro.com</a>.
